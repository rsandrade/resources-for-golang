# Resources for Golang

My own list  of useful Golang resources
    
## Database

[mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) - sqlite3 driver conforming to the built-in database/sql interface

## GUI

[gobuffalo/packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) - Packr is a simple solution for bundling static assets inside of Go binaries. Most importantly it does it in a way that is friendly to developers while they are developing.
